## Compile-Time Concepts and Optimization


The introduction of the TBD keyword would establish file-scoped variables and constants as compile-time concepts. This approach provides several advantages, particularly in terms of optimization capabilities:

1. **Compile-Time Concepts**:
    - **Definition**: Variables and constants declared with the TBD keyword are confined to the file in which they are declared and do not exist beyond the compilation phase.
    - **Behavior**: These elements are not included in runtime constructs such as the Reflection API or variable variables, ensuring that their scope and lifecycle are strictly limited to the file during compilation.

2. **Optimization Capabilities**:
    - **Memory Management**: Since TBD variables and constants are resolved at compile time, they do not occupy memory beyond their file scope. This reduces memory overhead and enhances performance.
    - **Code Optimization**: The compiler can perform more aggressive optimizations by knowing that TBD elements do not escape their file scope. This can lead to improved inlining, dead code elimination, and other optimizations.
    - **Isolation and Encapsulation**: By restricting the scope of TBD elements to a single file, it becomes easier to reason about the code, which can lead to more effective static analysis and optimization strategies.

3. **Implementation Considerations**:
    - **Parser and Compiler Adjustments**: The PHP parser and compiler will need to recognize and handle the TBD keyword appropriately, ensuring that these elements are treated as compile-time entities.
    - **Tooling Support**: IDEs, static analyzers, and other development tools will need to incorporate support for the TBD keyword, enabling developers to leverage these optimizations seamlessly.
