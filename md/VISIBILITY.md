# Defining "Visibility" in PHP
Visibility refers to the scope within which symbols can be accessed. Visibility controls access levels to these elements and ensures encapsulation, enhancing security and modularity in code.

## Why Do We Need File-Scoped Visibility in PHP?
**File-scoped visibility**, proposed to be implemented using the TBD keyword, addresses several critical needs in PHP development:

- **Encapsulation**: By restricting access to symbols within a single file, file-scoped visibility ensures better encapsulation. This prevents unintended interactions with other parts of the codebase and maintains a clear separation of concerns.

- **Alternate to Static Classes**: There are many PHP developers who actively dislike seeing `static` classes used as an alternate to namespaces, but many other PHP developers continue to use `static` classes in that manner as `static` classes allow for reducing the visibility of a long-lived variable to within just the one class.
  Adding a TDB keyword support would give developers a viable alternative to using `static` classes for encapsulation.

- **Reduced Naming Conflicts**: As projects grow, the risk of naming conflicts increases. File-scoped visibility prevents global namespace pollution, allowing developers to use the same names in different files without conflict, thereby reducing the risk of accidental name collisions.

- **Enhanced Security**: Sensitive data and functions can be confined within a single file, limiting their exposure and reducing the attack surface. This adds an extra layer of security by preventing access from outside the file.

- **Improved Code Organization**: File-scoped visibility encourages developers to organize code into self-contained, modular files. This makes the codebase easier to understand, maintain, and debug, promoting cleaner and more maintainable code structures.

By addressing these needs, file-scoped visibility will help PHP developers create more robust, secure, and maintainable applications.
