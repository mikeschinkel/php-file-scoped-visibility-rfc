# Open Questions
1. What is the `fileonly` keyword going to be?

2. Can `fileonly`-declared variables be implemented in a more performant manner and require less memory than regular PHP variables by following any _(additional)_ constraints, even is the optimizing implementation is postponed to a future RFC?
